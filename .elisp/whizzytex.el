;;; Commentary:
;;
;; WhizzyTeX is a minor Emacs mode for previewing LaTeX while your editing
;;
;; To install whizzytex, your also need its two companion files
;;   
;;   whizzytex             (A bash shell-script)
;;   whizzytex.sty         (A LaTeX macro package)
;;
;; The variable whizzy-command-name should be the relative or full path
;; of the executable shell-script, which should itself contain provide the
;; full or relative part of whizzytex.sty in its PACKAGE variable.
;;
;; To install whizzytex, then add to your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;   (autoload 'whizzytex-mode "whizzytex"
;;        "WhizzyTeX, a minor-mode WYSIWYG environment for LaTeX" t)
;; 
;; To launch WhizzyTeX, tyoe Esc-x whizzytex-mode
;; This applies only to the current buffer.
;;
;; Some user variable control the setting.
;; See the documentation for details by typing (once autoloaded)
;; 
;;    Esc-x describe-function whizzytex-mode
;;

    (setq-default whizzytex-mode-hook nil)

To customize whizzytex, you can

    (setq-default whizzytex-mode-hook
       '(lambda () ... <your settings> ...))

where <your settings> should include `whizzy-default-bindings' if you wish
to keep default bindings, since your value of the hook will be used instead

default options.")

    ("-pdf" "xpdf")

  "*Alist defining accepted previewers and their default configuration.

The first element of the list (which should never be empty), defines the 
default previewer. Hence, you can use:

    (setq-default whizzy-viewers \'((\"-dvi\" \"xdvi\") (\"-ps\" \"gv\")))

to make xdvi the default previewer.

Each element of the alist is of the form

  <type> <command> <option list>

where

  <type> can only be \"-advi\", \"-dvi\", \"-ps\", or \"-pdf\"

  <command>

    is a string that defines the default previwer command for that previewer
    type, including its command line options, but the filename will be added
    by whizzytex.
  
  <option list>

    is a list of strings that defines the default options to pass to
    whizzytex for that previewer type. Liktely to be nil, since options
    passed to whizzytex are usually file dependant.
    (see `whizzy-write-configuration' for details)
    
Moreover, <type> and <default-command> should agree in the following way:

  -dvi and -advi

    tell whizzytex to produce DVI files and to use signal SIGUSR1 to tell
    the previewer to reload the file. Examples of commands are xdvi and advi.
    With -advi, the command need to be an ActiveDVI previewer.  See also
    `whizzy-line', and `whizzy-point-visible'.

  -ps

    tells whizzytex to produce Postscript files (using dvips) and to use
    signal SIGHUP to tell the previewer to reload the file. Example is gv.

  -pdf

    tells whizzytex to produce PDF files (using pdflatex) and to use
    xpdf to preview them and xpdf -reload to reload the file. 
    Currently, no other option if left for the previewer.


In addition -advi tell whizzytex to tell latex to dump source line number
and file name information into the DVI file as additional \\special commands
of the form

    line: <line number> <file name>

A click in the previewr can then be turn into a possition into the source

This enables advi to turn pages automatically so as to follow the cursor, 
by inserting the HTML anchor Start-Document near the cursor.
To benefit from this feature, the previewer must be called with the option
 -html Start-Document.  

However, this makes WhizzyTeX more fragile, because the slice must be
instrumented with additiocal code, which at some position may unfortunaly
make the slice erroneous.

instrumented with additiocal code, which at some position may unfortunaly
make the slice erroneous.

Variable `whizzy-cursor-autohide', when set, makes point invisible after 
slicing errors until (one slice after) the error is fixed.

This can be toggled from the menu bar or with `whizzy-toggle-point'.

such as x-symbol, do not treat this properly.

  "Switch whizzytex mode according to ARG.

If ARG is null, toggle the mode in the current buffer. 

Otherwise, according to the numeric value of ARG it turns mode on (> 0)
or off (< 0) in the current buffer, or turn the mode off in the master buffer 
and all its slaves if (= 0). If the mode is already on while turn on, 
it is first turn off, then on. 

Turning the mode ON assigns (or reassigns) values to WhizzyTeX parameters
searching configuration information in order in the current file 
\(see `whizzy-write-configuration'), in configuration files 
\(see `whizzy-add-configuration'), in global values (see `whizzy-viewers' 
and `whizzy-class-mode-alist'), or prompting the user when essential 
information is missing.

If ARG is 4 or higer, the user is always asked to confirm/change the
default setting, interactively. (See also `whizzy-change-mode')

If ARG is 16, whizzytex is started in debug mode. Then, and only then, 
log files will be kept in case of failure during initialization. 

This command also evaluates `whizzytex-mode-hook' before setting up
file dependent variables. By default is equal to `whizzy-default-bindings'
and used to set up some bindings. File dependent hook defined in
`whizzy-hook-alist' that match the filename are evaluated.

You can also set default values to WhizzyTeX user variables in your eamcs
configuration file (usually ~/.emacs) by inserting lines of the form: 

        (setq-default VARIABLE VALUE)

The following variables can be customized: 

 - Settings:

    `whizzy-command-name'
    `whizzy-slicing-commands'
    `whizzy-viewers'
    `whizzy-class-mode-alist'
    `whizzy-mode-regexp-alist'
    `whizzy-select-mode-regexp-alist'
    `whizzy-paragraph-regexp'
    `whizzy-slice-pages'
    `whizzy-configuration-path'
    `whizzy-configuration-alist'
    `whizzy-hook-alist'
    `whizzytex-mode-hook'

 - Limiting WhizzyTeX features (which may sometimes lead to LaTeX errors):

    `whizzy-line'
    `whizzy-point-visible'
    `whizzy-overlays'

 - Controling recompilation (which may affect speed):

    `whizzy-auto-recompile'

 - User Interaction:

    `whizzy-save-buffers'
    `whizzy-auto-visit'
    `whizzy-auto-raise'
    `whizzy-auto-show-output'
    `whizzy-pop-up-windows'

 - Downgrade performance for compatibility with other packages:

    `whizzy-use-write-annotate'

 - Transparent customization of the latex document under whizzytex.

    `whizzy-customize'

 - Customizing faces: 

    `whizzy-slice-face'
    `whizzy-error-face' 

 - Check `whizzytex-version' for WhizzyTeX version number.

the interpretation of the rest of the line:

%; whizzy-master <name>

  The is used for files mastered by another file. That is, it is not
  LaTeX-ed directly, but  loaded by another LaTeX file. Conversely, the
  second and last line are used for master files. For WhizzyTeX, a master
  file is one that contains a \documentclass command and \begin{document}
  commands. Other files are treated as mastered.

  <name>
     is the relative or fullname of the master file

%; whizzy-macros <name>

  This is equivalent to whizzy-master <name>, but for a file containing
  macros. Such a file is not sliced while editing, but saving it reformats
  the master. 

%; whizzy [ <slicing> ] [ <viewer> [ <command> ] ] [ -pre <make> ]  ... [ -trace ]

  All arguments are optional, but if present they must be passed in order:

  <slicing>

     describes the way buffer is sliced (a slice is the region of the
     buffer under focus and displayed).

     See `whizzy-mode-regexp-alist' for a list of all slicing modes
     and `whizzy-class-mode-alist' for default mode selection when ommitted.

  <viewer>

     defines the type of previewer used (see `whizzy-viewers').
     This value is both interpretted by emacs and passed to the whizzytex
     script.

  <command>

     is only passed to the whizzytex script (not interpreted by emacs)
     this is the command that whizzytex should call to launch the
     previewer (see the manual). Command include the name of the
     previewer as well as its options. It is does not have to be quoted.
     It extends to the right as must as possible, i.e. ends with the end
     of line or some recognized option.
        
  -ext <suffix>
  
     makes <suffix> the latex file extension, instead of the sufffix of
     the master file taken by default.

  -mkslice <command>

     This tells whizzytex to preprocess the slice with <command> instead 
     of simply renaming the slice. The convention is that WhizzyTeX prepares 
     a slice  BASENAME.new, calls <command> BASENAME.tex, which should
     produce a file BASENAME.tex

     When the option is ommitted,  BASENAME.new is renamed into BASENAME.tex

  -mkfile <command>

     runs <command> <filename> every time a (master or slave) buffer is saved,
     and before reformating or recompiling. The default is to do nothing. 
     <filename> is the path of buffer-file-name relative to the master file
     directory.

  -makeindex <command>

     uses <command> instead of 'makeindex' to build index if needed.
     If command is false, indexes will never be recompiled.

  -initex <command>

     uses <command> instead of the default, usually 'initex', 
     to create the initial format. 

  -latex <command>

     This tells whizzytex to use <command> to compile a slice instead of
     the default (usually latex)

  -format <format>

     uses <format> instead the default, usually 'latex' 
     (the format extension ---see below--- is always added). 
     For instance, hugelatex may be needed for processing large files.

  -fmt <suffix>

     uses the <suffix> extension for format files instead  of fmt. 

  -dvicopy <command>

     uses <command> instead of the default (mv) to copy the DVI files
     (from FILE.dvi to FILE.wdvi). This can be used with command dvicopy,
     so as to expand virtual fonts, which advi does not understand yet.

  -duplex

     also launches a previewer on the whole document.

  -watch

     watches other files than just latex sources.

  -trace

     traces all commands of the script. 

%; whizzy-save <emacs-lisp-function>

     This assigns <emacs-lisp-function> to variable `whizzy-save'.
     (See the documentation.)

%; whizzy-paragraph <regexp>

  <regexp>
     defined overrides the slicing mode to paragraph and locally overrides
     the default paragraph regexp."
